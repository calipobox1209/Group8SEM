# Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

* Respect: Treat each other with respect. We are a diverse team with different backgrounds and perspectives. No form of 
  harassment, discrimination, or bullying will be tolerated.
* Communication: Communicate clearly and effectively. Offer and accept feedback graciously. Ask for help when needed, and 
  offer help to those who ask.
* Collaboration: Work together to solve problems, meet deadlines, and achieve goals. Share knowledge and experience with 
  team members.
* Responsibility: Take responsibility for your contributions. If you commit to doing something, do it to the best of your 
  ability. If you cannot fulfill a commitment, communicate this early to the team.
* Integrity: Act with integrity. Do not plagiarize, manipulate data, or engage in any other form of academic dishonesty.
* Inclusivity: Ensure a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex     characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality,        personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
