Main goals for the session: 
- Agree how and when we will meet throughout the week
- Agree what we will use for Kanban board (projects?/Atlassian Jira?/Teams?/any others?)
- Take the time to think about what our product backlog is going to look like
- Agree a timeframe for each sprint (maybe different from Mon-Fri standard if timeframes show it's needed?)
- Define a code of conduct
