What has everyone done since the last stand-up?
What are we going to do before the next stand-up?
What is getting in our way?



Scrum Process
How do we run a Scrum team?

Produce an initial product backlog.
Prioritise the backlog.
Do an initial estimate of the work.
Decide on what work to do in the next Sprint - Sprint Planning.
Every day have a daily stand-up - Daily Scrum.
End of the Sprint, review - Sprint Review.
Analyse how the team has worked and modify based on outcome of review: update estimates, add new tasks, learn lessons, etc. - Sprint Retrospective.
Repeat 4-7 until product is delivered to the customer.

Sprint Review:

Is there anything we can do differently to speed things up?
Can we offload some Backlog items (i.e. give them to other teams)?
Can we not do some things (i.e. remove items from the backlog)?
